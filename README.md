# Redash ChatGPT Plugin

The Redash ChatGPT Plugin integrates natural language conversation capabilities powered by ChatGPT into your Redash dashboard. This plugin enables users to engage in interactive and conversational queries, generating human-like responses and providing data visualization directly within the chat interface.

## Features

- **Conversational Queries:** Users interact with Redash using natural language queries for a more intuitive experience.
- **Interactive Responses:** ChatGPT generates human-like responses, offering informative and contextual feedback on queries.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize query results within the chat interface, allowing faster data exploration and analysis.

## Installation

Before installing the Redash ChatGPT Plugin, ensure you have a Redash instance installed on your local machine by following the [Local Development Setup guide](https://github.com/getredash/redash/wiki/Local-development-setup).

For more reference and information about Redash, visit [Redash's official website](https://redash.io/).

### Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
poetry add openai
yarn add react-icons
yarn add react-syntax-highlighter
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Copy Files:**

    Copy the `chat` folder from `client/app/components/chat` to the corresponding location in Redash's `client/app/components` folder.

    Copy the `chat.py` file from `redash/handlers/chat.py` to the corresponding location in Redash's `redash/handlers` folder.

2. **Update Redash Source Code:**

    Modify `client/app/components/ApplicationArea/ApplicationLayout/index.jsx`:

    ```javascript
    import ChatBox from "@/components/chat/ChatBox";

    // ... existing code

    return (
        // ... existing return code

        <div>
            <ChatBox/>
        </div>

        // ... existing code
    );
    ```

    Create a new file `chat.js` in `client/app/services` and add:

    ```javascript
    import { axios } from "@/services/axios";

    const Chat = {
        openai: data => axios.post('api/chat', data),
    };

    export default Chat;
    ```

    Update `redash/handlers/api.py`:

    ```python
    from redash.handlers.chat import ChatResource

    api.add_org_resource(ChatResource, "/api/chat", endpoint="chat")
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**

    Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=*****************************************
    ```

4. **Rebuild Your Redash Instance:**

    After making the necessary modifications, rebuild your Redash instance.

You're now ready to engage in insightful conversations with AI directly within your Redash dashboard!
